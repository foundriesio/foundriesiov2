      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this blog, I describe how to run the Google Assistant SDK on a Raspberry Pi with an external speaker and microphone.  After you get things configured and gather key pieces of information you&amp;rsquo;ll have a simple, portable and easy to reproduce Google Assistant appliance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>It seems every industry is placing bets on how blockchain technologies will revolutionize the way they do business. The internet of things is not immune to this hype, but the fundamental question remains. How can it be useful?
Centralized vs Decentralized Trust Models The flow of data, that is what the internet of things is all about. How to retrieve it, where to store it, and who can access it.</description>

      <title>How To Manage LMP Containers</title>
      <link>https://foundries.io/insights/2018/01/17/20180117-container-management/</link>

      <guid>https://foundries.io/insights/2018/01/17/20180117-container-management/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Linux microPlatform uses a set of Docker containers to provide end-to-end
services used by the Zephyr microPlatform. The containers and their
configurations are deployed using a simple &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/OpenSourceFoundries/gateway-ansible&#34;&gt;shell script&lt;/a&gt; that wraps
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ansible.com/&#34;&gt;Ansible&lt;/a&gt;. The scripts require a version of Ansible
with Docker support. Some distro packages such as Ubuntu 16.04 don&amp;rsquo;t have this,
so make sure you install Ansible from a &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_installation.html&#34;&gt;proper source&lt;/a&gt;
before continuing.
