We have announced our first equity round of $3.5M, and we have introduced FoundriesFactory - a cloud service to help companies development secure, deploy and continually maintain products through their complete lifecycle - for IoT and Edge applications, accelerating time to market and reducing costs.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Foundries.io raises $3.5 million to fix security and device management for IoT and Edge</title><link>https://foundries.io/insights/2019/10/22/20191022-foundriesio-funding-fix-iot-security/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundries.io/insights/2019/10/22/20191022-foundriesio-funding-fix-iot-security/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Cambridge, UK, 22nd October 2019: Foundries.io, a leading open IoT platform company, today announces a $3.5M funding round to advance its secure operating system platform. The round is led by Crane Venture Partners, with participation from Backed VC.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>180 days</title><link>https://foundries.io/insights/2018/03/30/20180330_goodfriday_180days/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundries.io/insights/2018/03/30/20180330_goodfriday_180days/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s March 30, 2018, Good Friday, and it has been 180 days since we started Foundries.io. In this time, we established our initial infrastructure, created the first microPlatform products and, on March 27, we produced our 12th update to the microPlatforms, roughly 1 update every 2 weeks. When we started the microPlatforms, we wanted to get our systems and processes running smooth enough to provide meaningful software updates that could be integrated into products by our subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may think that consuming software updates every 2 weeks is daunting, however, the upstream projects are ever-evolving and in this same period, Zephyr has seen 3,385 commits and the Linux Kernel has seen 28,876 commits and we arenâ€™t even listing the changes of the other software projects. Long story short, with all this activity, there are new features and fixes that affect all aspects of computing that your products may have missed out on. With the microPlatforms we have created a product that not only keeps you close to the latest software, but standards-based and fully tested end-to-end for use within connected IoT products.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
