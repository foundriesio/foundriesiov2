Then the dust settled from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/mirantis-acquires-docker-enterprise/&#34;&gt;Docker spinoff&lt;/a&gt;.
What we now know is that Docker Apps is an inactive project. tldr; It&amp;rsquo;s not
a big deal for our customers and they are going to automagically get
something better very soon:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Running Rancher k3s as a Docker App</title><link>https://foundries.io/insights/2019/12/10/20191209-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundries.io/insights/2019/12/10/20191209-kubernetes/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In less than a decade, containers and, subsequently, container orchestration have exploded into almost every modern development stack.&lt;/p&gt;
