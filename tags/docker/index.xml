      <description>Portainer has been a great asset and we have started to rely on it for single-container image management. Unfortunately, Portainer has been designed for 2 key use-cases. single containers and &amp;ldquo;stacks&amp;rdquo; that are meant to be deployed onto Kubernetes or Swarm orchestrators. For many of our demos we want to manage a suite of containers and orchestrate their startup so we can manage large container suites like the 9+ container-based micro-services that comprise the Edge-X project.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Foundries.io, we are constantly looking across the ecosystem for the best projects to complement the microPlatforms.  One such project is &lt;a href=&#34;https://portainer.io&#34; title=&#34;Portainer&#34;&gt;Portainer&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;ldquo;Portainer is an open-source lightweight management UI which allows you to easily manage your Docker hosts or swarm clusters.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How To Manage LMP Containers</title>
      <link>https://foundries.io/insights/2018/01/17/20180117-container-management/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Linux microPlatform uses a set of Docker containers to provide end-to-end
services used by the Zephyr microPlatform. The containers and their
configurations are deployed using a simple &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/OpenSourceFoundries/gateway-ansible&#34;&gt;shell script&lt;/a&gt; that wraps
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ansible.com/&#34;&gt;Ansible&lt;/a&gt;. The scripts require a version of Ansible
with Docker support. Some distro packages such as Ubuntu 16.04 don&amp;rsquo;t have this,
so make sure you install Ansible from a &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_installation.html&#34;&gt;proper source&lt;/a&gt;
before continuing.

      <title>Simplify your life: multi-architecture docker containers</title>
      <link>https://foundries.io/insights/2018/01/17/20180117-multi-arch-containers/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The great thing about Docker is that your developers run the exact same container as what runs in production.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what the Docker hype is about, creating reproducibile environments for applications. The technology enables us to create lightweight, secure microservices which run on an array of SoCs that can be updated over the air in a matter of seconds. We believe that accelerating code delivery will ultimately reduce time to market. Hype aside, Docker has matured and has become a foundational building block of our microPlatforms.
