Then the dust settled from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/mirantis-acquires-docker-enterprise/&#34;&gt;Docker spinoff&lt;/a&gt;.
What we now know is that Docker Apps is an inactive project. tldr; It&amp;rsquo;s not
a big deal for our customers and they are going to automagically get
something better very soon:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>FoundriesFactory TUF Keys Rotation</title><link>https://foundries.io/insights/2020/03/05/20200305-key-rotation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundries.io/insights/2020/03/05/20200305-key-rotation/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Built on a vision that the latest software is the most secure, software

Foundries.io. However, in a world of buzzword bingo like Kubernetes,

to feel neglected. This article discusses one way we are helping: building
armhf containers efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Running Rancher k3s as a Docker App</title><link>https://foundries.io/insights/2019/12/10/20191209-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundries.io/insights/2019/12/10/20191209-kubernetes/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In less than a decade, containers and, subsequently, container orchestration have exploded into almost every modern development stack.&lt;/p&gt;

Security vulnerabilities, both on the software and hardware side are driving the embedded industry to adopt new ways to develop these systems. The writing has been on the walls for a while now, and this shift away from monolithic applications to microservices has been happening in the cloud for many years.
The &amp;ldquo;internet of things&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;edge&amp;rdquo; computing have brought cloud developers closer to embedded systems than ever before.</description></item><item><title>Using docker-compose.yml with Portainer</title><link>https://foundries.io/insights/2018/05/08/using-docker-compose.yml-with-portainer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 May 2018 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundries.io/insights/2018/05/08/using-docker-compose.yml-with-portainer/</guid><description>Portainer has been a great asset and we have started to rely on it for single-container image management. Unfortunately, Portainer has been designed for 2 key use-cases. single containers and &amp;ldquo;stacks&amp;rdquo; that are meant to be deployed onto Kubernetes or Swarm orchestrators. For many of our demos we want to manage a suite of containers and orchestrate their startup so we can manage large container suites like the 9+ container-based micro-services that comprise the Edge-X project.</description></item><item><title>Portainer Container Management on Linux microPlatform</title><link>https://foundries.io/insights/2018/05/07/20180508-portainer-container-management-on-linux-microplatform/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 May 2018 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundries.io/insights/2018/05/07/20180508-portainer-container-management-on-linux-microplatform/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;At Foundries.io, we are constantly looking across the ecosystem for the best projects to complement the microPlatforms.

services used by the Zephyr microPlatform. The containers and their
configurations are deployed using a simple &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/OpenSourceFoundries/gateway-ansible&#34;&gt;shell script&lt;/a&gt; that wraps
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ansible.com/&#34;&gt;Ansible&lt;/a&gt;. The scripts require a version of Ansible
with Docker support. Some distro packages such as Ubuntu 16.04 don&amp;rsquo;t have this,
so make sure you install Ansible from a &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_installation.html&#34;&gt;proper source&lt;/a&gt;
before continuing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Simplify your life: multi-architecture docker containers</title><link>https://foundries.io/insights/2018/01/17/20180117-multi-arch-containers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2018 13:07:31 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://foundries.io/insights/2018/01/17/20180117-multi-arch-containers/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The great thing about Docker is that your developers run the exact same container as what runs in production.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what the Docker hype is about, creating reproducibile environments for applications. The technology enables us to create lightweight, secure microservices which run on an array of SoCs that can be updated over the air in a matter of seconds. We believe that accelerating code delivery will ultimately reduce time to market. Hype aside, Docker has matured and has become a foundational building block of our microPlatforms.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
