Security vulnerabilities, both on the software and hardware side are driving the embedded industry to adopt new ways to develop these systems. The writing has been on the walls for a while now, and this shift away from monolithic applications to microservices has been happening in the cloud for many years.
The &amp;ldquo;internet of things&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;edge&amp;rdquo; computing have brought cloud developers closer to embedded systems than ever before.</description></item><item><title>How To Manage LMP Containers</title><link>https://foundries.io/insights/2018/01/17/20180117-container-management/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2018 13:50:46 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://foundries.io/insights/2018/01/17/20180117-container-management/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The Linux microPlatform uses a set of Docker containers to provide end-to-end
services used by the Zephyr microPlatform. The containers and their
configurations are deployed using a simple &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/OpenSourceFoundries/gateway-ansible&#34;&gt;shell script&lt;/a&gt; that wraps
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ansible.com/&#34;&gt;Ansible&lt;/a&gt;. The scripts require a version of Ansible
with Docker support. Some distro packages such as Ubuntu 16.04 don&amp;rsquo;t have this,
so make sure you install Ansible from a &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_installation.html&#34;&gt;proper source&lt;/a&gt;
before continuing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
