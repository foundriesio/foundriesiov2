The &amp;ldquo;one size fits all&amp;rdquo; approach of a modern Linux distro does not meet the requirements of the IoT and Edge markets because of the diversity of hardware and use cases - from cellular-connected sensors, to industrial IoT infrastructure, to gateways and even autonomous vehicle computing. More complex use-cases and more powerful processors almost universally use some variant of Linux. Simpler devices such as sensors typically use an RTOS. In this article we focus on Linux - a future article will explore the many RTOS options.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Foundries.io makes IoT deployable using Linux and Zephyr microPlatforms™</title><link>https://foundries.io/insights/2019/06/05/20190605-deployable-iot-zmp-lmp/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundries.io/insights/2019/06/05/20190605-deployable-iot-zmp-lmp/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;brings-secure-supportable-longevity-to-iot-installed-devices&#34;&gt;Brings secure, supportable longevity to IoT installed devices&lt;/h3&gt;

The internet of things is not immune to this hype, but the fundamental question remains. How can it be useful?
Centralized vs Decentralized Trust Models The flow of data, that is what the internet of things is all about. How to retrieve it, where to store it, and who can access it.</description></item></channel></rss>
