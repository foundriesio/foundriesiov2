Hackers are extorting more money out of a wider range of companies and corporations, with the latest estimates being that attacks have increased by 500% in the last year.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The OTA updatable OS for your next IoT or Edge Product</title><link>https://foundries.io/insights/2019/07/05/20190705-ota-updatable-os/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundries.io/insights/2019/07/05/20190705-ota-updatable-os/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Why is there no Android or Red Hat Enterprise Linux for IoT and Edge devices? The &amp;ldquo;one size fits all&amp;rdquo; approach of a modern Linux distro does not meet the requirements of the IoT and Edge markets because of the diversity of hardware and use cases - from cellular-connected sensors, to industrial IoT infrastructure, to gateways and even autonomous vehicle computing. More complex use-cases and more powerful processors almost universally use some variant of Linux. Simpler devices such as sensors typically use an RTOS. In this article we focus on Linux - a future article will explore the many RTOS options.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Foundries.io makes IoT deployable using Linux and Zephyr microPlatformsâ„¢</title><link>https://foundries.io/insights/2019/06/05/20190605-deployable-iot-zmp-lmp/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundries.io/insights/2019/06/05/20190605-deployable-iot-zmp-lmp/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;brings-secure-supportable-longevity-to-iot-installed-devices&#34;&gt;Brings secure, supportable longevity to IoT installed devices&lt;/h3&gt;
