This got me nostalgic and I’ve put together a list of our &amp;ldquo;greatest hits&amp;rdquo;.
These builds represent pivotal moments in our history.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What&#39;s a Target?</title><link>https://foundries.io/insights/2020/05/14/whats-a-target/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundries.io/insights/2020/05/14/whats-a-target/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A Foundries Factory is a unique new concept. Conceptualizing a Factory can
sometimes seem difficult. I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered this enough to see a common
problem - we are looking at things the wrong way.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>LMP Container Orchestration Roadmap - Episode 2</title><link>https://foundries.io/insights/2020/04/17/container-orchestration-v2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundries.io/insights/2020/04/17/container-orchestration-v2/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Back in December, we laid out a roadmap for
&lt;a href=&#34;https://foundries.io/insights/2019/12/04/20191205-container-orchestration-roadmap/&#34;&gt;container orchestration&lt;/a&gt;.
Then the dust settled from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/mirantis-acquires-docker-enterprise/&#34;&gt;Docker spinoff&lt;/a&gt;.
What we now know is that Docker Apps is an inactive project. tldr; It&amp;rsquo;s not
a big deal for our customers and they are going to automagically get
something better very soon:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Configuration Management of Devices</title><link>https://foundries.io/insights/2020/04/01/200401-fioconfig/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundries.io/insights/2020/04/01/200401-fioconfig/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last month our engineering team has been working on a way to provide
our customers an easy-to-use mechanism for managing on-device configuration.
The result is a new project we call &amp;ldquo;fioconfig&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Building 32-bit Arm Containers</title><link>https://foundries.io/insights/2020/02/25/20200226-armh-contatiners/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundries.io/insights/2020/02/25/20200226-armh-contatiners/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We strongly believe in the power of containers for embedded development at
Foundries.io. However, in a world of buzzword bingo like Kubernetes,
serverless, and Edge, people working on 32 bit Arm hardware would be right
to feel neglected. This article discusses one way we are helping: building
armhf containers efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Running Rancher k3s as a Docker App</title><link>https://foundries.io/insights/2019/12/10/20191209-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundries.io/insights/2019/12/10/20191209-kubernetes/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In less than a decade, containers and, subsequently, container orchestration have exploded into almost every modern development stack.&lt;/p&gt;

The &amp;ldquo;one size fits all&amp;rdquo; approach of a modern Linux distro does not meet the requirements of the IoT and Edge markets because of the diversity of hardware and use cases - from cellular-connected sensors, to industrial IoT infrastructure, to gateways and even autonomous vehicle computing. More complex use-cases and more powerful processors almost universally use some variant of Linux. Simpler devices such as sensors typically use an RTOS. In this article we focus on Linux - a future article will explore the many RTOS options.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Foundries.io makes IoT deployable using Linux and Zephyr microPlatforms™</title><link>https://foundries.io/insights/2019/06/05/20190605-deployable-iot-zmp-lmp/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundries.io/insights/2019/06/05/20190605-deployable-iot-zmp-lmp/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;brings-secure-supportable-longevity-to-iot-installed-devices&#34;&gt;Brings secure, supportable longevity to IoT installed devices&lt;/h3&gt;
