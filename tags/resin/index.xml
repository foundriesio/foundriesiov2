&lt;p&gt;“The great thing about Docker is that your developers run the exact same container as what runs in production.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what the Docker hype is about, creating reproducibile environments for applications. The technology enables us to create lightweight, secure microservices which run on an array of SoCs that can be updated over the air in a matter of seconds. We believe that accelerating code delivery will ultimately reduce time to market. Hype aside, Docker has matured and has become a foundational building block of our microPlatforms.
