the Service you
agree to be bound by these terms. Note that this is a legally binding agreement that explains the
terms and
restrictions under which you agree to use the Service.</p><h4>Agreement</h4><ul><li>In this Agreement a "Product" is defined as an embedded, IoT or Edge hardware device that is
sold in any volume to end customers, either directly or
through distribution channel(s). For the purposes of this agreement a set of Products that run a
single binary software
build image are regarded as a single Product. For example a device that is shipped with several
different memory or
other configurations is regarded as a single Product provided that all variants use the same
binary software build
image.</li><li>You may only use the the Service to develop, test, deploy and maintain Product(s).</li><li>A separate Personal or Enterprise subscription is required for each Product for which you create
a FoundriesFactory.</li><li>You agree to be bound by the relevant open source licenses for any software that you download
from this website, or from
<a target=_blank href=https://github.com/foundriesio>github.com/foundriesio</a>. A list of licenses
can be found in the factory build license manifest file.</li><li>The Linux microPlatform and other open source software provided in the Service contains
encryption software and is subject to
UK, European and US export control laws and may also be subject
to export and import regulations in other countries (“export laws”). BEFORE using the software,
please check your
country's export laws, regulations and policies concerning the import, possession, or use, and
re-export of encryption
software, to see if this is permitted. See www.wassenaar.org for more information.</li><li>Our provision of the Service is dependent on third party providers including but not limited to
cloud
services provided by Amazon and Google. Our goal is 100% uptime for the Service, but you
understand
that this is not guaranteed, and you agree that we have no responsibility if we are temporarily
unable to provide the
Service.</li><li>You agree that all software provided by Foundries.io is provided to you on an “as is” basis.
Foundries.io makes no
warranty, express, implied or statutory, with respect to any of the software and you expressly
assume all liabilities
and risks for use or operation of the software. Should the software prove defective, you agree
that you assume the
entire cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.</li><li>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will Foundries.io be liable for
any indirect, special,
incidental or consequential damages (including loss of profits) arising out of the use or
inability to use the software,
whether based on a claim under contract, tort or other legal theory, even if Foundries.io was
advised of the possibility
of such damages.</li><li>Foundries.io does not seek to limit or exclude liability for death or personal injury arising
from Foundries.io’s
negligence, and because some jurisdictions do not permit the exclusion or limitation of
liability for consequential or
incidental damages, some of the above limitations may not apply to you.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, the maximum liability of
Foundries.io to you in
aggregate for all claims made against Foundries.io in contract tort or otherwise in connection
with this agreement shall
not exceed the greater of; i) the total sums paid for the FoundriesFactory subscription(s) in
the past three years, and
ii) $10.00 USD. The existence of more than one claim will not enlarge or extend the limit.</li><li>You are free to give notice of termination of your subscription at any time. Because
subscription fees are payable in
advance, termination of this agreement will occur on conclusion of the last day of the prepaid
month or year (“the
termination date”) during which termination notice is given to Foundries.io and you will be free
to continue to enjoy
the full benefits of the Service until the termination date. Following the termination date you
may
continue to use any software previously supplied to you under the terms of this agreement, which
shall survive the
termination of your subscription.</li><li>The provision of the Service is subject to “fair use” limitations. If in Foundries.io sole
opinion you
are exceeding reasonable use we will first contact you to try to resolve the issue. If we are
unable to resolve the
issue to your satisfaction your sole remedy shall be to terminate your subscription, and you may
request a refund for
any unused term prepaid beyond the termination date.</li><li>This agreement is governed under English Law. If any clause or sentence in this agreement is
held by a court of law to
be illegal or unenforceable the remaining provisions of this agreement shall not be affected
thereby.</li><li>From time to time we may notify you of changes to this agreement by email. If you do not agree
to the changes you will
continue to be bound by these terms for any previous FoundriesFactory deliverables to you. You
will be required to
accept the changes if you wish to continue your subscription. If you do not wish to accept the
new terms you may
terminate your subscription and request a refund for any unused term prepaid beyond the
termination date.</li></ul></div></div></section><footer><div class="row footerlinks"><div class="columns small-12 medium-6 border-right"><h2>Company</h2><ul><li><a href=https://foundries.io/company/>About</a></li><li><a href=https://foundries.io/careers/>Careers</a></li><li><a href=https://support.foundries.io/>Support</a></li><li><a href=https://status.foundries.io/>System status</a></li><li><a href=https://foundries.io/privacy/>Privacy</a></li><li><a href=https://foundries.io/terms/>Terms</a></li></ul></div><div class="columns small-12 medium-6"><h2>Connect</h2><ul class=social-links><li><a href=https://twitter.com/foundriesio><i class="fa fa-twitter fa-2x"></i></a></li><li><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/company/foundriesio/><i class="fa fa-linkedin fa-2x"></i></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/foundriesio><i class="fa fa-github fa-2x"></i></a></li><li><a href=https://join.slack.com/t/foundriesio/shared_invite/enQtNTc5NDkxNTI5NTExLWQ1Yjc3NDA2MjI3NzA3YzkxYjEzNzlhZjQ0M2QxYTIzYmIzZjlmOThmZGU0NTk5MWEwZGIwMTU2YWE4N2I5NWQ><i class="fa fa-slack fa-2x"></i></a></li></ul></div></div><p class=copyright>Copyright 2018 &ndash; 2020 Foundries.io All rights reserved</p></footer><script type=application/javascript>var doNotTrack=false;if(!doNotTrack){(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');ga('create','UA-111281311-1','auto');ga('send','pageview');}</script><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js integrity="sha256-FgpCb/KJQlLNfOu91ta32o/NMZxltwRo8QtmkMRdAu8=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=/js/vendor/wow.min.js></script><script src=/js/vendor/what-input.min.js></script><script src=/js/vendor/hoverIntent.js></script><script src=/js/vendor/jquery.responsiveTabs.js></script><script src=/js/vendor/superfish.min.js></script><script src=/js/vendor/owl.carousel.min.js></script><script src=/js/vendor/foundation.min.js></script><script src=/js/vendor/jquery.slicknav.min.js></script><script src=/js/custom.min.js></script><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/cookieconsent@3/build/cookieconsent.min.js></script><script>window.cookieconsent.initialise({"cookie":{"name":"fio_consent","domain":".foundries.io","secure":false},"palette":{"popup":{"background":"#37485c"},"button":{"background":"#14a7d0"}},"position":"bottom-right","content":{"header":'Cookies used on this website!',"target":"_blank","link":false,"message":"This website uses cookies to enable us to improve your experience, as explained in our Privacy Policy.<br><br>By using this website you agree to our <a class='cc-link' target='_blank' href='https://foundries.io/terms#website'>Terms and Conditions</a> and to our <a class='cc-link' taget='_blank' href='https://foundries.io/privacy/'>Privacy Policy</a>","href":"https://foundries.io/privacy/"}});</script><script src=/js/rtabs.min.js></script></body></html>
