&lt;a href=&#34;https://foundries.io/insights/2019/12/04/20191205-container-orchestration-roadmap/&#34;&gt;container orchestration&lt;/a&gt;.
Then the dust settled from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/mirantis-acquires-docker-enterprise/&#34;&gt;Docker spinoff&lt;/a&gt;.
What we now know is that Docker Apps is an inactive project. tldr; It&amp;rsquo;s not
a big deal for our customers and they are going to automagically get
something better very soon:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Configuration Management of Devices</title><link>https://foundries.io/insights/2020/04/01/200401-fioconfig/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundries.io/insights/2020/04/01/200401-fioconfig/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last month our engineering team has been working on a way to provide
our customers an easy-to-use mechanism for managing on-device configuration.
The result is a new project we call &amp;ldquo;fioconfig&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Building 32-bit Arm Containers</title><link>https://foundries.io/insights/2020/02/25/20200226-armh-contatiners/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundries.io/insights/2020/02/25/20200226-armh-contatiners/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We strongly believe in the power of containers for embedded development at
Foundries.io. However, in a world of buzzword bingo like Kubernetes,
serverless, and Edge, people working on 32 bit Arm hardware would be right
to feel neglected. This article discusses one way we are helping: building
armhf containers efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>LMP Container Orchestration Roadmap</title><link>https://foundries.io/insights/2019/12/04/20191205-container-orchestration-roadmap/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundries.io/insights/2019/12/04/20191205-container-orchestration-roadmap/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Container orchestration in the embedded space lacks a good story and vision.

Security vulnerabilities, both on the software and hardware side are driving the embedded industry to adopt new ways to develop these systems. The writing has been on the walls for a while now, and this shift away from monolithic applications to microservices has been happening in the cloud for many years.
The &amp;ldquo;internet of things&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;edge&amp;rdquo; computing have brought cloud developers closer to embedded systems than ever before.</description></item></channel></rss>
