The &amp;ldquo;one size fits all&amp;rdquo; approach of a modern Linux distro does not meet the requirements of the IoT and Edge markets because of the diversity of hardware and use cases - from cellular-connected sensors, to industrial IoT infrastructure, to gateways and even autonomous vehicle computing. More complex use-cases and more powerful processors almost universally use some variant of Linux. Simpler devices such as sensors typically use an RTOS. In this article we focus on Linux - a future article will explore the many RTOS options.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Google Assistant on the LmP</title><link>https://foundries.io/insights/2018/05/09/google-assistant-on-the-lmp/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 May 2018 19:48:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundries.io/insights/2018/05/09/google-assistant-on-the-lmp/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In this blog, I describe how to run the Google Assistant SDK on a Raspberry Pi with an external speaker and microphone.

Unfortunately, Portainer has been designed for 2 key use-cases. single containers and &amp;ldquo;stacks&amp;rdquo; that are meant to be deployed onto Kubernetes or Swarm orchestrators. For many of our demos we want to manage a suite of containers and orchestrate their startup so we can manage large container suites like the 9+ container-based micro-services that comprise the Edge-X project.</description></item><item><title>Portainer Container Management on Linux microPlatform</title><link>https://foundries.io/insights/2018/05/07/20180508-portainer-container-management-on-linux-microplatform/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 May 2018 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundries.io/insights/2018/05/07/20180508-portainer-container-management-on-linux-microplatform/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;At Foundries.io, we are constantly looking across the ecosystem for the best projects to complement the microPlatforms. One such project is &lt;a href=&#34;https://portainer.io&#34; title=&#34;Portainer&#34;&gt;Portainer&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;ldquo;Portainer is an open-source lightweight management UI which allows you to easily manage your Docker hosts or swarm clusters.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>180 days</title><link>https://foundries.io/insights/2018/03/30/20180330_goodfriday_180days/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundries.io/insights/2018/03/30/20180330_goodfriday_180days/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s March 30, 2018, Good Friday, and it has been 180 days since we started Foundries.io. In this time, we established our initial infrastructure, created the first microPlatform products and, on March 27, we produced our 12th update to the microPlatforms, roughly 1 update every 2 weeks. When we started the microPlatforms, we wanted to get our systems and processes running smooth enough to provide meaningful software updates that could be integrated into products by our subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may think that consuming software updates every 2 weeks is daunting, however, the upstream projects are ever-evolving and in this same period, Zephyr has seen 3,385 commits and the Linux Kernel has seen 28,876 commits and we aren’t even listing the changes of the other software projects. Long story short, with all this activity, there are new features and fixes that affect all aspects of computing that your products may have missed out on. With the microPlatforms we have created a product that not only keeps you close to the latest software, but standards-based and fully tested end-to-end for use within connected IoT products.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How To Manage LMP Containers</title><link>https://foundries.io/insights/2018/01/17/20180117-container-management/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2018 13:50:46 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://foundries.io/insights/2018/01/17/20180117-container-management/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The Linux microPlatform uses a set of Docker containers to provide end-to-end
services used by the Zephyr microPlatform. The containers and their
configurations are deployed using a simple &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/OpenSourceFoundries/gateway-ansible&#34;&gt;shell script&lt;/a&gt; that wraps
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ansible.com/&#34;&gt;Ansible&lt;/a&gt;. The scripts require a version of Ansible
with Docker support. Some distro packages such as Ubuntu 16.04 don&amp;rsquo;t have this,
so make sure you install Ansible from a &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_installation.html&#34;&gt;proper source&lt;/a&gt;
before continuing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Simplify your life: multi-architecture docker containers</title><link>https://foundries.io/insights/2018/01/17/20180117-multi-arch-containers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2018 13:07:31 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://foundries.io/insights/2018/01/17/20180117-multi-arch-containers/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The great thing about Docker is that your developers run the exact same container as what runs in production.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what the Docker hype is about, creating reproducibile environments for applications. The technology enables us to create lightweight, secure microservices which run on an array of SoCs that can be updated over the air in a matter of seconds. We believe that accelerating code delivery will ultimately reduce time to market. Hype aside, Docker has matured and has become a foundational building block of our microPlatforms.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
