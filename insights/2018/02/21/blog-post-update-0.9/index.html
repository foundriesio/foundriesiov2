flash device when the board runner supports it. This
ensures a consistent initial state. It can be disabled
using the CONF_ZEPHYR_TRY_MASS_ERASE bootloader
configuration option.</li></ul><h4 id=bugs>Bugs</h4><h5 id=zephyr-workaround-for-flash-driver-name-rename>Zephyr workaround for FLASH_DRIVER_NAME rename:</h5><ul><li>The Zephyr port has a shim to work around a rename of
