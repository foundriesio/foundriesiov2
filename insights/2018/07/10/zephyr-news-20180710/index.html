be expected this early in the Zephyr 1.13 development cycle.
Commits in the Drivers, Arches and Networking areas accounted
for over 50% of the changes.</p><p>This newsletter covers the following inclusive commit range:</p><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/commit/3bdb52f1ad577b7e77b10c4cd83807196d97e479>3bdb52f1</a> doc: improved error reporting for non-UTF8 docs</li><li><a href=https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/commit/25b0212fc36a4d6414bb20f06a794ebe89f91f0f>25b0212f</a> subsys: usb: class: add loopback function</li></ul><h2 id=important-changes>Important Changes</h2><p><strong>Kconfig removal of all redundant default &ldquo;n&rdquo; settings:</strong></p><p>A series of Kconfig-related patches removed all redundant default
&ldquo;n&rdquo; settings across the entire Zephyr tree. This change <em>shouldn&rsquo;t</em>
affect behavior; however, it will make any out of tree patches
affecting Kconfig files a bit more difficult to merge for this
cycle.</p><p><strong>New functionality for the console driver/subsystem:</strong></p><p>The console driver/subsystem went through a fairly large refactor
to remove the dependency on a FIFO-based console input abstraction.
This allows supporting Segger&rsquo;s RTT technology as a console backend.
The <code>CONFIG_CONSOLE_PULL</code> knob was renamed to <code>CONFIG_CONSOLE_SUBSYS</code> as
part of these changes. This signifies that the subsystem is intended
to cover all of Zephyr&rsquo;s console handling (existing and new).</p><p>Applications using the old configuration name will need updates.</p><h2 id=features>Features</h2><p><strong>Arches:</strong></p><p>Initial Cortex M4 support was added for the i.MX 6SoloX SoC. It&rsquo;s a
hybrid multi-core processor composed of one Cortex A9 core and one
Cortex M4 core. The low level drivers come from the NXP FreeRTOS BSP
and are located at <a href=https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/master/ext/hal/nxp/imx/>ext/hal/nxp/imx</a>. More details can be found in
<a href=https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/master/ext/hal/nxp/imx/README>ext/hal/nxp/imx/README</a>.</p><p>Microsemi Mi-V RISC-V softcore CPU support was added for running
on the M2GL025 IGLOO2 FPGA development board. This required moving
some code from the fe310 platform into the RISC-V privilege common
folder.</p><p>Zephyr support was added for Nordic&rsquo;s nRF52810 SoC. This is a low-cost
variant of the nRF52832, with a reduced set of peripherals and memory.
Since Nordic does not offer a development kit for the nRF52810,
the <code>nrf52810_pca10040</code> board definition can be used with the nRF52832-DK
(<code>nrf52_pca10040</code>). Using this board definition enforces the limitations
imposed by the nRF52810 IC.
For more information, see
<a href=http://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/nRF52810>http://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/nRF52810</a></p><p>An nRF5x peripheral list was created that can be used to describe
each nRF5x SoC. Kconfig can use this description to help configure
only drivers that are available for a particular SoC.</p><p>Support was added for the STM32F7 and STM32F2 series of STM32 SoCs.
This includes clock control, entropy, GPIO, flash, pinmux, and UART
drivers, as well as several device trees and board definitions for
STM32F7 Discovery, STM32F207XG, and STM32F207XE development hardware.</p><p>The ESP32 IDF bootloader now has a Kconfig option for compilation during
the Zephyr build. At flash time, the bootloader will be flashed with
the Zephyr image.</p><p>Nordic and STM32 SoCs can now use Segger&rsquo;s RTT protocol for console
output, in addition to UART.</p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong></p><p>Controller support was added for the Nordic nRF52810.</p><p>A new Bluetooth Mesh node sample was added in
<a href=https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/tree/master/samples/boards/nrf52/mesh/onoff_level_lighting_vnd_app>samples/boards/nrf52/mesh/onoff_level_lighting_vnd_app</a>.
It demonstrates several generic and light models.</p><p>The BLE controller Kconfig options were reorganized. <code>CONFIG_BT_CTLR</code>
means that a controller is implemented, with additional options
(currently just <code>CONFIG_BT_LL_SW</code>) selecting a specific implementation.
This allows adding alternative controller implementations in the future.</p><p>If the Bluetooth device is neither an observer or has central role
selected, the scan related code is excluded from the HCI core.
This results in smaller image sizes for peripheral- or broadcasting-only
roles.</p><p>A Kconfig option <code>CONFIG_BT_CTLR_CRYPTO</code> was added to allow
flexibility in choosing to use host cryptographic functions or the ones
provided by the BT controller.</p><p><strong>Boards:</strong></p><p>A new &ldquo;shields&rdquo; configuration was added to establish connector flags
for compatibility checks. Arduino compatible serial, I2C and SPI
were the first shield compatibility additions, with ST&rsquo;s nucleo_f429zi
board making use of them. Expect more on this front as time goes on.</p><p>Several new boads were added: i.MX&rsquo;s UDOO Neo Full SBC and ST&rsquo;s
STM32F746G-DISCO, STM32F723E-DISCO and STM32F769I-DISCO.</p><p>The I2C ports of several nRF-based boards were enabled.</p><p><strong>Build:</strong></p><p>An LLVM backend and a clang toolchain variant were added to support
building with llvm (included with many popular Linux distributions).
Initial testing was done on quark_d2000_crb and
quark_se_c1000_devboard/Arduino 101. To enable this, set
<code>ZEPHYR_TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT</code> to <code>clang</code> in your environment.</p><p>Architectures, boards, and apps can now override the C standard version,
which was previously set to <code>-std=c99</code>. Currently, the native POSIX
port uses this feature in <a href=https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/master/boards/posix/native_posix/CMakeLists.txt>boards/posix/native_posix/CMakeLists.txt</a></p><p><code>set_property(GLOBAL PROPERTY CSTD c11)</code></p><p><strong>Device Tree:</strong></p><p>Nordic boards moved I2C enablement, SDA and SCL pin configuration,
and LED / button definitions into DTS.</p><p>STM32F7-pinctrl added definitions for USART/UARTs.</p><p><strong>Documentation:</strong></p><p>Information about the websocket server API was added to Zephyr&rsquo;s
documentation. For details, see
<a href=http://docs.zephyrproject.org/api/networking.html#websocket>http://docs.zephyrproject.org/api/networking.html#websocket</a></p><p>Intel S1000 developers will be happy to note that the docs
now include instructions for obtaining the toolchain from:
<a href=https://tensilicatools.com/platform/intel-sue-creek>https://tensilicatools.com/platform/intel-sue-creek</a>.</p><p>As part of Zephyr&rsquo;s security development process, certain external
requirements require justification that threats in a threat model have
been mitigated. To make this process traceable, the threats must be
enumerated and given labels. For this purpose, labels were added to
the threats in Zephyr&rsquo;s sensor threat model. See the model itself
for more details
<a href=http://docs.zephyrproject.org/security/sensor-threat.html>http://docs.zephyrproject.org/security/sensor-threat.html</a></p><p>Ever wonder how DTS relates to Kconfig options? Wonder no more!
Some clarification was added to the Device Tree documentation at
<a href=http://docs.zephyrproject.org/devices/dts/device_tree.html#dt-vs-kconfig>http://docs.zephyrproject.org/devices/dts/device_tree.html#dt-vs-kconfig</a></p><p>The &ldquo;Getting Started&rdquo; document did not clearly state how to use
a custom cross compiler. This was remedied with a new section
&ldquo;Using Custom Cross Compilers&rdquo;. See the details at
<a href=http://docs.zephyrproject.org/getting_started/getting_started.html>http://docs.zephyrproject.org/getting_started/getting_started.html</a></p><p>Information on the newly-supported gPTP protocol was added to the
networking documentation.</p><p><strong>Drivers:</strong></p><p>STM32F2 and STM32F7 received clock_control, flash, GPIO, pinmux,
UART, entrophy and interrupt_controller drivers.</p><p>The native POSIX Ethernet driver now has support for gPTP.</p><p>A generic I2C EEPROM slave driver was added.</p><p>USB drivers received several additions, such as high-speed support for
DesignWare USB controllers, and an API for USB BOS (Binary Object
Store) descriptors.</p><p>USB HID payload size is now configurable via
<code>CONFIG_USB_HID_MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE</code> (the previous value of 64 is still the
default).</p><p>Shims for nRFx TWI, TWIM and PWM drivers were added and the now
redundant i2c_nrf5 shim was removed.</p><p>A PTP clock driver was introduced which can be implemented in
those network interface drivers that provide gPTP support.</p><p>An LED driver for NXP PCA9633 (I2C 4-bit LED) was added which supports
a blink period from 41ms to 10667ms and a brightness value from 0 to 100%.</p><p><strong>External:</strong></p><p>The NXP iMX6 FreeRTOS BSP was imported to add Zephyr support on
iMX6SX processors (exclusively on the Cortex M4 core), and to speed
up the development process.</p><p>The Nordic nRFX HAL was updated to support the nRF52810.</p><p>STM32cube updates for all STM32 families (including the addition of
STM32F2x HAL) were also merged.</p><p>The Segger RTT debug code was updated to version 6.32d.</p><p>MCUMGR external sources were updated to external commit a837a731 from
<a href=https://github.com/apache/mynewt-mcumgr>https://github.com/apache/mynewt-mcumgr</a>.</p><p><strong>Kernel:</strong></p><p>Back in Zephyr 1.12, the old scheduler&rsquo;s thread queueing code was replaced
with the choice of a &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; list or a balanced tree. The old multi-queue
algorithm is still useful in some use cases, such as applications
with large-ish numbers of runnable threads that don&rsquo;t need or want
fancy features like EDF or SMP affinity. To fill this gap, the old
implementation was reintroduced, and can be enabled using
<code>CONFIG_SCHED_MULTIQ</code>.</p><p><strong>Miscellaneous:</strong></p><p>The logging subsystem saw many new features merged, including:
support for multiple backends, improving real-time performance by deferring
logging to a separate runtime context, timestamps, and filtering
options (which are compile time, runtime, module level, instance level).
The console backend was added as the first backend example.</p><p><strong>Networking:</strong></p><p>gPTP (Precision Time Protocol) support was added to according to
the IEEE 802.1AS-2011 standard. To enable it, use <code>CONFIG_NET_GPTP</code>.
Note: at this time, gPTP is only supported for boards that have
Ethernet ports which support collecting timestamps for sent and
received Ethernet frames. A gPTP sample was added at
<a href=https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/tree/master/samples/net/gptp>samples/net/gptp</a>.</p><p>Also new to Zephyr is the LLMNR (Link Local Multicast Name Resolution)
client and responder from RFC 4795. LLMNR is used in Windows
networks. A caller can be set up to resolve DNS resource records
using multicast DNS, as well as configured to listen for LLMNR DNS
queries and respond to them. Related Kconfig options
are <code>CONFIG_LLMNR_RESOLVER</code> and <code>CONFIG_LLMNR_RESPONDER</code>. The implementation
is in <a href=https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/tree/master/subsys/net/lib/dns>subsys/net/lib/dns</a>.</p><p><strong>Samples:</strong></p><p>Socket API-based samples for echo_client and echo_server were added
to Zephyr as well as a simple logger sample illustrating the new
capabilities of the logger subsystem additions.</p><p>LLMNR client support was added to the DNS resolver sample.</p><p>A sample application for testing the NXP PCA9633 LED driver was added.</p><p><strong>Scripts:</strong></p><p>The Kconfiglib project in Zephyr saw a couple of updates.
1) Dependency loop detection. Until now, dependency loops have
raised a hard-to-debug Python <code>RecursionError</code> during evaluation.
Now, a <code>Kconfiglib</code> exception is raised instead, with a message
that lists all the items in the loop.
2) <code>MenuNode.referenced()</code> was converted to a property, making
the API more consistent (read-only values are accessed with properties).
3) Warnings for choice overrides were eliminated.</p><p>The nrfjprog runner script was updated to accept a <code>--snr</code> parameter
specifying the serial number of the device to be operated on.</p><p>Device tree now allows the use of a new element of DTC grammar called
overriding nodes. It looks like this in a board&rsquo;s dts file
<code>arduino_i2c: &amp;i2c1 {};</code>
This overriding node information is used during the DTS include
file generation like so
<code>#define ARDUINO_I2C_LABEL ST_STM32_I2C_V1_40005400_LABEL</code></p><p>In this way, <code>ARDUINO_I2C_LABEL</code> could be used as a generic binding name.
This change is derived from a dtc commit in version v1.4.2.</p><h2 id=bug-fixes>Bug Fixes</h2><p><strong>Arches:</strong></p><p>The ARM/NXP MPU code was cleaned up a bit to avoid configuring
out-of-bound MPU regions. Also, the ARM MPU code had several
Zephyr defines replaced with direct uses of CMSIS defines.</p><p>When compiling, both cortex-m0 and cortex-m0plus will now use
<code>-march=armv6s-m</code> instead of <code>-march=armv6-m</code> to to ensure the svc
directive exists.</p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong></p><p>Bluetooth Mesh now depends on <code>CONFIG_BT_BROADCASTER</code> and <code>CONFIG_BT_OBSERVER</code>,
as they are necessary to implement Mesh devices. Several other
Mesh-related bugfixes landed to solve initialization order during
node reset, redundant model publication clearing, cyclic rewriting
to flash when restoring state, checking for a model subscription
address, and ignoring prohibited element addresses.</p><p>For the Bluetooth Controller core, LE Extended Scanner Filter Policy
now depends on <code>CONFIG_BT_OBSERVER</code> and the time to transmit an empty
packet was raised from 40 microseconds to 44 microseconds on a 2M PHY,
due to an additional byte of preamble.</p><p>The BlueNRG-MS HCI driver received a pair of changes. In the first, it
now reads from the controller as long as the IRQ is high. In the
second, it makes sure to configure the BlueNRG-MS to controller mode
just after it&rsquo;s ready by disabling &ldquo;HCI reset&rdquo; via a quirk.</p><p><strong>Boards:</strong></p><p>The BlueNRG-MS Bluetooth configuration had to be fixed on the
<code>disco_l475_iot1</code> board. This includes SPI3 usage, SYSCLK adjustments,
and a few build warnings.</p><p><strong>Build:</strong></p><p>The gen_isr_tables script received several updates for
simplification and dead code removal.</p><p>Python script &ldquo;process_gperf.py&rdquo; used in the Zephyr build system
will now be invoked via &ldquo;python&rdquo; instead of called directly.
This avoids non-portable shebang logic and/or &ldquo;default application&rdquo;
behaviour.</p><p><strong>Device Tree:</strong></p><p>STM32F4 saw corrected pin assignment of node <code>usart6@0</code>.</p><p><strong>Drivers:</strong></p><p>RTC syscall changes required a build error fix.</p><p>A build error was addressed for <code>intel_s1000</code> which uses
DesignWare USB. It doesn&rsquo;t inherit qmsi header which
has several definitions used in the driver. Instead make
sure those definitions exist in a a DesignWare specific
header.</p><p>A build error in uart_handler.c was fixed when <code>CONFIG_UART_LINE_CTRL</code>
is defined.</p><p>Fixes were applied to the nRF UART driver for broken hardware
flow control and interrupt driven APIs.</p><p>For the USB/DFU subsystem, bcdUSB had been previously updated
from 1.1 to 2.0 in the default device descriptor, but not in the
DFU class. After USB bus reset performed by dfu-util, this alternative
descriptor registered with bcdUSB was set to 1.1. This mismatch caused
a communication failure. The DFU descriptor&rsquo;s bcdUSB was
updated to match the default value.</p><p>The STM32 clock control driver received a fix to HCLK calculation
when using MSI. The MSI clock signal can be selected in several ranges.
These ranges should be taken into account for calculating its
frequency and hence global system frequency. This change is
used when enabling Bluetooth on the <code>disco_l475_iot1</code> board.</p><p>A long-standing issue where the K64F-FRDM board would generate a
random MAC address on every boot (which would lead to DHCP address
exhaustion) has been solved. The existing Kconfig option
<code>CONFIG_ETH_MCUX_0_RANDOM_MAC</code>, which dynamically chooses a random MAC
address, is now one choice among many in the new
<code>CONFIG_ETH_MCUX_0_MAC_SELECT</code> option. The other choices are
<code>CONFIG_ETH_MCUX_0_UNIQUE_MAC</code> (the new default), which uses the MCU
unique identification register to generate a stable MAC address which
is persistent over reboots, and <code>CONFIG_ETH_MCUX_0_MANUAL_MAC</code>, which
allows setting a fixed MAC address. For details, see
<a href="http://docs.zephyrproject.org/reference/kconfig/choice_55.html?highlight=eth_mcux_0_mac_select">http://docs.zephyrproject.org/reference/kconfig/choice_55.html?highlight=eth_mcux_0_mac_select</a></p><p>NETUSB and STM32 ethernet hardware apparently never called
<code>ethernet_init()</code>. This was revealed when the <code>net_arp_init()</code>
function was moved into <code>ethernet_init()</code> and ARP tables stopped
being initialized correctly, and has been fixed.</p><p><strong>External:</strong></p><p>PWM related nrfx_config entries for nRF52840 needed to have their
#ifdef logic reversed in order to enable properly.</p><p>For STM32F4xx and STM32F7xx, the I2SR field needed to be shifted
by <code>RCC_PLLI2SCFGR_PLLI2SR_Pos</code> when the <code>PLLI2SCFGR</code> register is read
or written. Previously, the configuration was not done properly
(R and M params were badly set) and the <code>PLLI2S</code> was generating a
bad clock waveform.</p><p><strong>Networking:</strong></p><p>The &ldquo;net app&rdquo; layer has historically been the combination of 2
separate but useful parts: 1) a library to set up client and server
connections (<code>CONFIG_NET_APP</code>) and 2) a library to set up/configure
networking on application startup (<code>CONFIG_NET_APP_SETTINGS</code>).
As this second functionality is useful in almost every circumstance,
it has been split out into a new top-level networking library
under <a href=https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/tree/master/subsys/net/lib/config>subsys/net/lib/config</a>. In the future, this would also allow other
networking frameworks such as sockets to use these configuration
options. This move will cause issues for out of tree patches to
the net app layer.</p><p>The layer 2 networking code was also moved as having it under
subsys/net/ip/l2 didn&rsquo;t make much logical sense. The new location
is <a href=https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/tree/master/subsys/net/l2>subsys/net/l2</a>. Hopefully, this movement didn&rsquo;t result in any
functional changes, but only time will tell. Developers should
note that any local patches to the old layer 2 location will need
to be refactored.</p><p>Zephyr&rsquo;s ARP table implementation was cleaned up slightly and
optimized for memory usage through the use of a single linked
list, smaller ARP entries, and handling request timeouts
in a single <code>k_delayed_work</code> structure.</p><p><strong>Samples:</strong></p><p>Several changes were applied to the Bluetooth Mesh nRF52
on/off level lighting sample at
