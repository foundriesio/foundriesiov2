(&ldquo;net: samples: Add TLS support to socket echo_client/echo_server&rdquo;),
merged 26 July 2018</li></ul><h2 id=important-changes>Important Changes</h2><p><strong>Initial socket-based TLS support:</strong></p><p>Initial support was added for network communication via TLS through
the sockets API. Support includes:</p><ul><li>a credential management subsystem: the <code>&lt;net/tls_credentials.h&gt;</code> API
allows users to define and manage a pool of <em>credentials</em>, which
include certificates, private keys, and pre-shared symmetric
keys. The nonstandard <code>TLS_SEC_TAG_LIST</code> <code>setsockopt()</code> option was
added to allow credential selection.</li><li>I/O syscalls: <code>send()</code>, <code>recv()</code>, and <code>poll()</code> support was added
(poll() was also made thread safe).</li><li>hostname support: the <code>TLS_HOSTNAME</code> socket option can be used to
set the system&rsquo;s hostname.</li><li>handshake management: cipher suite management is done via the
<code>TLS_CIPHERSUITE_LIST</code> and <code>TLS_CIPHERSUITE_USED</code> socket options;
the <code>TLS_PEER_VERIFY</code> option can be used to override mbedTLS&rsquo;s
default settings for peer verification.</li><li>sample support: the <code>http_get</code> and <code>big_http_download</code> now support
TLS sockets, including certificate validation via Let&rsquo;s Encrypt
certificates provided with the samples. TLS support was also added
to the <code>echo_client</code> and <code>echo_server</code> samples.</li></ul><p>The merger of this code is a significant change, as it unblocks
rewrites or adaptations of Zephyr&rsquo;s network protocol support stacks
(such as MQTT, HTTP, CoAP and LWM2M, etc.) to support TLS via a
setsockopt() API.</p><p><strong>Standard C Memory Allocation:</strong></p><p>Built-in support was added for <code>malloc()</code>, <code>free()</code>, <code>calloc()</code>,
<code>realloc()</code>, and <code>reallocarray()</code>. The size of the memory pool which
backs these allocations is determined by
<code>CONFIG_MINIMAL_LIBC_MALLOC_ARENA_SIZE</code>, which defaults to zero to
disable these functions unless they are needed. Support for this
implementation is incompatible with use of the Newlib C library (which
provides its own primitives based on a <code>_sbrk()</code> implementation
provided by its runtime environment.)</p><p><strong>New &ldquo;Logger&rdquo; Subsystem:</strong></p><p>Zephyr has a new logging subsystem called Logger, which lives in
<code>subsys/logging</code>, and which now has <a href=http://docs.zephyrproject.org/subsystems/logging/logger.html>upstream
documentation</a>.
This is a significant departure, both in terms of supported features
and complexity, from the longstanding SYS_LOG APIs in <code>&lt;logging/sys_log.h&gt;</code>.</p><p>It seems to be early days, as no upstream subsystems have been moved
over to Logger from SYS_LOG. It&rsquo;s not clear if Logger will replace
SYS_LOG in the long term.</p><p>Foundries.io is publishing a blog series discussing both Logger and
SYS_LOG. The <a href=https://foundries.io/blog/2018/07/24/zephyr-logging-part-1/>SYS_LOG post is
available</a>,
and we&rsquo;ll be releasing part 2 on Logger pending the results of a pull
request containing some <a href=https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/pull/9129>minor bug
fixes</a>.</p><p><strong>Zephyr SDK minimum version bumped to 0.9.3:</strong></p><p>Linux users who build with the Zephyr SDK are advised that the minimum
version has been increased from 0.9.2 to 0.9.3, which was released in
May. Zephyr will now refuse to build programs with older SDK versions.</p><p><strong>Networking promiscuous mode support:</strong></p><p>A new API was merged to <code>&lt;net/net_if.h&gt;</code> which allows entering and
exiting promiscuous mode, as well as querying this mode, on a
per-interface basis:</p><ul><li><code>net_if_set_promisc(struct net_if*)</code></li><li><code>net_if_unset_promisc(struct net_if*)</code></li><li><code>net_if_is_promisc(struct net_if*)</code></li></ul><p>Currently, support, testing, and samples are provided for Ethernet
L2s. Users curious to try it out should see
<code>samples/net/promiscuous_mode</code>.</p><p><strong>Application shared memory:</strong></p><p>When userspace is enabled, Zephyr now supports control of shared
memory regions between threads. <a href=http://docs.zephyrproject.org/kernel/usermode/usermode_sharedmem.html>General usage
information</a>
has been added to Zephyr&rsquo;s documentation.</p><p><strong>Ethernet driver API break:</strong></p><p>The API in <code>&lt;net/ethernet.h&gt;</code> saw an incompatible change. The
<code>get_stats</code> API callback now takes a <code>struct device *</code>, rather than a
<code>struct net_if *</code>. In-tree users were updated; out of tree users will
need updates.</p><p><strong>Network packet format change:</strong></p><p>The IPv6 implementation now handles large packets correctly. Fixing
this required some changes to <code>struct net_pkt</code>, the core
representation for network packets.</p><p><strong>sys_clock_us_per_tick deprecated:</strong></p><p>Usage of this variable was deprecated, as its value does not portably
fit into an integer. Users are directed to use
<code>sys_clock_hw_cycles_per_sec</code> and <code>sys_clock_ticks_per_sec</code> instead.</p><h2 id=features>Features</h2><p><strong>Arches:</strong></p><p>The Atmel SAM SoC files saw a cleanup as part of the SAMD20 support
effort described below.</p><p>ARC architecture support for nsim was added.</p><p>Initial support for a new caching infrastructure on ARM SoCs was added
with support for memory caching on ARM MPUs. See <a href=https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/issues/8784>issue
8784</a> for
more details and current status.</p><p>On x86, Zephyr can now boot on systems with a 64-bit BIOS, and got SoC
support for Apollo Lake. A new architecture-specific <code>CONFIG_REALMODE</code>
option was added as well; this enables booting Zephyr from real mode
on x86, which was previously only available in the Jailhouse target.</p><p>The &ldquo;native POSIX&rdquo; pseudo-architecture grew support for registering
functions which run at exit via the <code>NATIVE_EXIT_TASK</code> macro available
in <code>&lt;soc.h&gt;</code></p><p>ARM SoCs gained new abilities to recover from otherwise-fatal MPU
faults.</p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong></p><p>Support was added for runtime configuration of the GAP device name.
Changes are persisted to nonvolatile memory if
<a href=http://docs.zephyrproject.org/reference/kconfig/CONFIG_BT_SETTINGS.html>CONFIG_BT_SETTINGS</a>
is enabled. The Bluetooth shell now has a <code>name</code> command which can be
used to exercise this feature; without arguments, it prints the
current name, and with a single argument, it sets the device name to
the given value.</p><p><strong>Boards:</strong></p><p>New board support was added for the Silabs EFR32 Flex Gecko Wireless
Starter Kit, Atmel SAMD20 XPlained Pro boards, nRF52 AdaFruit Feather,
nRF52840 USB Dongle and x86 UP Squared.</p><p>The stm32f723e_disco board now has support for USB FS OTG and I2C,
following the extension of driver support for those peripherals to
STM32F7 MCUs.</p><p>The nrf52_pca10040 board has the UARTE peripheral enabled; the console
now uses this instead of RTT.</p><p>FRDM-K64F now supports
<a href=http://docs.zephyrproject.org/devices/dts/flash_partitions.html>CONFIG_FS_FLASH_STORAGE_PARTITION</a>.</p><p>The <code>cc3220sf_launchxl</code> board now automatically reconnects to the last
known good WiFi AP at startup.</p><p><strong>Build:</strong></p><p><a href=https://crosstool-ng.github.io/>Crosstool-NG</a> (stylized &ldquo;xtools&rdquo;)
support has been added for the ARC architecture and IAMCU x86 variant.
Xtools support was also declared on QEMU for ARM Cortex M3, NIOS-II,
RISCV32, three variants of x86, and a couple of real ARM and x86
boards; this was merged as part of enabling CI testing for the new
toolchain.</p><p>Vigilant removal of redundant <code>default n</code> properties from Kconfig
files continues.</p><p>The build system&rsquo;s calls to <code>objcopy</code> now fill gaps with 0xff
bytes. This reduces time spent programming flash on some targets,
since this value is what erased flash pages are filled with. Flash
programmers which are smart enough to skip setting runs of 0xff will
thus see improvements.</p><p><strong>Cryptography:</strong></p><p>The subsystem-wide TLS rewrite saw an interesting new addition, in the
form of a &ldquo;generic&rdquo; mbedTLS configuration file in
<code>ext/lib/crypto/mbedtls/configs/config-tls-generic.h</code>. This is now the
default mbedTLS configuration file.</p><p>Users of the mbedTLS library will be familiar with its header-file
system of configuration: when the library is compiled with the macro
<code>MBEDTLS_CONFIG_FILE</code> defined, its sources include the file that macro
expands to, which in turn enables, disables, or configures their
features.</p><p>In the past, Zephyr has managed separate configuration files for
different use cases. With this new addition, a single mbedTLS file can
be maintained within tree, whose contents are controllable via Kconfig
options defined in <code>ext/lib/crypto/mbedtls/Kconfig.tls-generic</code>. This
bit of cleverness allows individual applications to set their TLS
configuration within Kconfig fragment files.</p><p><strong>Device Tree:</strong></p><p>Bindings for i.MX7d I2C and PWM drivers were added in
<code>dts/bindings/i2c/fsl,imx7d-i2c.yaml</code> and <code>fsl,imx7d-pwm.yaml</code>.</p><p>Bindings for STM32 OTG HS USB were added in
<code>dts/bindings/usb/st,stm32-otghs.yaml</code>, along with SoC DTSI nodes for
STM32F4 and STM32F7.</p><p><strong>Documentation:</strong></p><p>The documentation itself can now be built on all supported platforms,
following conversion of its build system to CMake, and some helper
scripts to Python. Its build system now also supports out of tree
builds and inclusion within other builds, among a variety of other
cleanups, fixes, and improvements.</p><p>The Doxygen documentation for the ARM SoC specific <code>_Fault()</code> routine,
which handles fatal errors, has been improved and clarified.</p><p><strong>Drivers:</strong></p><p>gPTP support was added for the MCUX-based Ethernet driver for NXP
devices.</p><p>An API was merged for Audio Codec devices. No drivers yet.</p><p>Support was added to the USB subsystem for <a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/usbcon/microsoft-defined-usb-descriptors>Microsoft OS Descriptors,
version
1</a>. Additionally,
USB device firmware authors can now override the
<code>usb_update_sn_string_descriptor()</code> function to populate serial number
descriptors at runtime.</p><p>PWM and I2C master drivers were added for the Cortex-M4 cores present
on NXP i.MX7 SoCs (the <code>nxp_imx/mcimx7_m4</code> SOC variant).</p><p>The nRF serial driver saw a lot of love. It now supports Device
Tree, power management, and both 31250 and 56000 baud rates. The
last improvement may be particularly useful for any users implementing
Zephyr-based dial-up modem support.</p><p>The SiLabs GPIO and UART drivers now have support for EFR32 MCUs.</p><p>Driver support was added for Analog Devices ADT7420 16-bit I2C
temperature sensors.</p><p>On STM32 MCUs:</p><ul><li><p>USB OTG support was added for STM32F7 by adapting existing
support for the STM32F4 series.</p></li><li><p>STM32F7 also grew I2C support.</p></li><li><p>The USB HS peripheral now has pin mux support for PB14/PB15 on
STM32F4.</p></li></ul><p><strong>External:</strong></p><p>The Zlib-licensed SiLabs &ldquo;Gecko SDK&rdquo; HAL was added, in order to
support EFR32 MCUs.</p><p>Version 1.2.91 of the Atmel SAMD20 HALs were merged, in order to
support the SAMD20 Xplained Pro board.</p><p>Kconfiglib was updated, bringing in support for the preprocessing
language extensions described in the Linux file
<a href=https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-macro-language.txt>kconfig-macro-language.txt</a>,
as well as adding additional warnings.</p><p><strong>Kernel:</strong></p><p>Applications can now define their own system calls using the
<a href=http://docs.zephyrproject.org/reference/kconfig/CONFIG_APPLICATION_DEFINED_SYSCALL.html>CONFIG_APPLICATION_DEFINED_SYSCALL</a>
Kconfig option. Previously, only source files in Zephyr&rsquo;s <code>include/</code>
directory were scanned by the build system when looking for supported
system calls.</p><p>Support for <code>read()</code> and <code>write()</code> was added when using Newlib.</p><p><strong>Libraries:</strong></p><p>Support for the CRC32 checksum algorithm was added to Zephyr&rsquo;s CRC
library. It can be accessed via <code>&lt;crc32.h&gt;</code>.</p><p>The JSON library grew a new helper macro with an apparently misleading
name. The macro in question, <code>JSON_OBJ_DESCR_ARRAY_ARRAY</code>, appears to
be used to declare descriptors for arrays of structs, rather than
arrays of arrays.</p><p>POSIX compatibility was added for the <code>pthread_once_t</code> and
<code>pthread_key_t</code> typedefs.</p><p><strong>Networking:</strong></p><p>The LWM2M implementation now allows its users to supply callbacks
which are invoked on object creation and deletion (which, in the LWM2M
protocol, may be initiated from across the network).</p><p><strong>Samples:</strong></p><p>A sample application demonstrating use of the new Analog Devices
ADT7420 16-bit I2C temperature sensor driver was added to
<code>samples/sensor/adt7420</code>.</p><p>The <code>boards/nrf52/mesh/</code> samples were updated to pass the Bluetooth
<a href=https://www.bluetooth.com/develop-with-bluetooth/qualification-listing/qualification-test-tools/profile-tuning-suite>Profile Tuning
Suite</a>,
among several other improvements.</p><p>The <code>gptp</code> networking sample has FRDM-K64F support, following the
addition of PTP protocol support to that board&rsquo;s Ethernet driver.</p><p><strong>Scripts:</strong></p><p>A new <code>import_mcux_sdk.py</code> script was added, which automates merging
of new versions of the NXP MCUX HAL.</p><p><strong>Testing:</strong></p><p>The sanitycheck script now supports nsim as an emulation backend,
following addition of this program as a mechanism for running ARC
binaries in emulation.</p><p>The saga continues on the large project of adding Doxygen-based
metadata to Zephyr&rsquo;s test infrastructure to support more sophisticated
CI, requirements traceability, etc.</p><p>A variety of tests were added or improved for multicore configurations
and power management.</p><h2 id=bug-fixes>Bug Fixes</h2><p><strong>Arches:</strong></p><p>ARM MPU support now follows recommendations for the proper use of data
and instruction synchronization barriers when enabling and disabling
the MPU.</p><p>Exception return on ARC no longer ignores updates to the PC register.</p><p><strong>Device Tree:</strong></p><p>The nRF UART0 peripheral with register base address 0x40002000 can be
of two types (UART or UARTE), depending on the SoC. An internal
cleanup fixing the dts.fixup and SoC dtsi files now forces their users
to declare which peripheral is in use.</p><p>The NXP device tree binding YAML files saw some cleanups and build
warning resolutions.</p><p><strong>Documentation:</strong></p><p>The documentation covering the gPTP networking protocol saw some fixes
and enhancements.</p><p><strong>Drivers:</strong></p><p>A bug causing overwritten GPIO configurations and unstable firmware on
Nordic devices was fixed.</p><p>The nRF serial port driver&rsquo;s dependency on the Zephyr GPIO driver was
replaced with calls into the nrfx GPIO HAL to avoid initialization
order issues (UART is needed early for the console, but the GPIO
driver isn&rsquo;t initialized until later in the boot).</p><p>The nRF timer driver saw a bug fix related to the combination of a
tickless kernel, <code>k_busy_wait()</code>, and <code>k_sleep()</code>.</p><p>Improved management support for nRF52, including a bug fix for wake
from sleep, were merged.</p><p><strong>External:</strong></p><p>Some out of tree patches were merged fixing bugs in the NXP MCUX
Ethernet HAL driver.</p><p><strong>Kernel:</strong></p><p>Conversion results between system ticks and milliseconds when the
system clock is set at runtime were fixed.</p><p>Use of the &lsquo;errno&rsquo; lvalue from userspace was fixed.</p><p>Use of the console from userspace with Zephyr&rsquo;s built-in libc was
fixed.</p><p><strong>Libraries:</strong></p><p>A variety of fixes were merged affecting printf format string parsing
and handling in Zephyr&rsquo;s &ldquo;minimal&rdquo; libc.</p><p>Similarly, measures were introduced to ease compilation of various
samples and libraries with the Newlib C library.</p><p><strong>Networking:</strong></p><p>The <code>getaddrinfo()</code> socket system call now properly allocates memory
for its results, which can be freed with <code>freeaddrinfo()</code>. Previously,
the implementation was simply using a global variable for its results,
which precluded concurrent usage.</p><p>The LWM2M implementation ignores TLV options it cannot handle, rather
than halting option processing when it receives one.</p><p>A potential null dereference in IPv6 address parsing was fixed, as was
a memory leak which occurs when a neighbor solicitation request fails.</p><p>A variety of cleanups and fixes were merged affecting IPv4 and ICMPv4
support.</p><p><strong>Samples:</strong></p><p>The <code>echo_server</code> sample now uses the correct networking APIs to
handle large IPv6 packets.</p><p>The Kconfig fragments used to build the <code>echo_client</code> and
<code>echo_server</code> applications with TLS support on <code>qemu_x86</code> were fixed,
restoring that sample&rsquo;s build in that configuration.</p><p><strong>Testing:</strong></p><p>A variety of incompatibilities between Zephyr&rsquo;s fixed size integer
types and those provided by the standard library were worked around or
fixed.</p><h1 id=individual-changes>Individual Changes</h1><p>Patches by area (391 patches total):</p><ul><li>Arches: 44</li><li>Bluetooth: 18</li><li>Boards: 21</li><li>Build: 15</li><li>Continuous
