<a href="https://www.zephyrproject.org/">Zephyr</a> development merged into
the <a href="https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr">mainline tree on
GitHub</a>.</p>

<h1 id="highlights">Highlights</h1>

<p>This newsletter covers changes in Zephyr between these two
commits (inclusive):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/commit/b742b62b6e2e402fbc0a159d180389dd912539f6">b742b62b</a> kconfiglib: Update to get split_expr() in</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/commit/dc97fc2a609eb4c1d64b2c963094e18682bfcaea">dc97fc2a</a> kconfiglib: Update to default to UTF-8 for Python 3</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="important-changes">Important Changes</h2>

<p><strong>Retpolines on x86</strong></p>

<p>x86 CPUs affected by Spectre v2 now support
<a href="https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7625886">retpolines</a> when
invoking interrupt and exception handlers, during thread entry, and
when invoking syscall handlers.</p>

<p>These changes also saw the removal of the (unused) _far_jump() and
_far_call() routines.</p>

<p><strong>LED and Button Definition Moves</strong></p>

<p>This continues the long-term project to move device configuration from
Kconfig to Device Tree.</p>

<p>LED and button definitions were removed from all STM32 board.h files,
since the corresponding defines now come from device tree. This is a
breaking change, as the old <code>XXX_GPIO_PORT</code> is now
<code>XXX_GPIO_CONTROLLER</code>. Applications which used the old names will need
updates.</p>

<p>NXP Kinetis SoCs were also converted to generate this information from
Device Tree. This change preserved names, but did not include updates
for the FXOS8700 or FXAS21002 temperature sensors or the MCR20A
802.15.4 radio. Users of those devices on NXP Kinetis boards should be
advised that <a href="https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/issues/7172">support is
broken</a> in
this Zephyr tree.</p>

<p><strong>Deprecated <code>__stack</code> macro removed</strong></p>

<p>The <code>__stack</code> macro, which was deprecated in favor of
<a href="http://docs.zephyrproject.org/api/kernel_api.html#c.K_STACK_DEFINE">K_STACK_DEFINE</a>
before v1.11 was released, has been removed.</p>

<p><strong>mbedTLS update to fix remote execution holes</strong></p>

<p>The mbedTLS cryptography library was updated from version 2.7.0 to
version 2.8.0, addressing CVEs
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0488">2018-0488</a>
and
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0487">2018-0487</a>. These
are remote execution vulnerabilities that could occur when TLS or DTLS
is in use.</p>

<p><strong>k_thread_cancel() deprecated</strong></p>

<p>The k_thread_cancel() API is deprecated. Applications should use
<a href="http://docs.zephyrproject.org/api/kernel_api.html#_CPPv214k_thread_abort7k_tid_t">k_thread_abort()</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Generic storage partition rename</strong></p>

<p>The NFFS <a href="http://docs.zephyrproject.org/devices/dts/flash_partitions.html">flash
partition</a>
available on many boards, which was previously aliased to
<code>nffs_partition</code>, has been renamed to <code>storage_partition</code>, to reflect
its general usefulness for a variety of storage systems. Its existence
is now controlled via a <a href="http://docs.zephyrproject.org/reference/kconfig/CONFIG_FS_FLASH_MAP_STORAGE.html#cmdoption-arg-config-fs-flash-map-storage">CONFIG_FS_FLASH_MAP_STORAGE</a>.</p>

<p>Out of tree applications using the old alias or configuration option
to access this partition will need updates.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p><strong>Architectures</strong>:</p>

<p>The ARC architecture now supports
<a href="http://docs.zephyrproject.org/reference/kconfig/CONFIG_STACK_SENTINEL.html">CONFIG_STACK_SENTINEL</a>,
which can help diagnose stack overflow issues.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/technology/about-real-time-transfer/">SEGGER
RTT</a>
support is now enabled on all NXP MCUs.</p>

<p>Support was added for Cadence&rsquo;s proprietary XCC compiler toolchain for
the XTensa architecture, along with support for the intel_s1000 SoC.
Judging from <a href="https://github.com/intel/rtos-drv-intel-s1000">these
drivers</a>, the SoC is
intended for use in speech and other audio processing. Zephyr
SoC-level support is provided for DMA, I2S, UART, GPIO, USB, and I2C,
with board support via intel_s1000_crb.</p>

<p><strong>Boards</strong></p>

<p>I2C driver support was enabled for all the official nRF5 boards
provided by Nordic Semiconductor.</p>

<p>The bbc_microbit now supports flash partitions for mcuboot and on-chip
storage.</p>

<p><strong>Build system</strong></p>

<p>A variety of improvements were merged into the build system.</p>

<p>Notably, the build system now caches information obtained from the
toolchain, optimizing subsequent invocations of cmake using the same
toolchain. Factor of two speedups have been observed when the cache is
used. A few problems have been identified and fixed up since the
initial merge, but hopefully the major issues are resolved.</p>

<p>In another significant addition, the build system now contains an
initial Python-based menuconfig alternative. This can currently be
used by running <code>ninja pymenuconfig</code> on all supported targets (though
Windows users will need to install an additional wheel). This is a
significant improvement for Windows users, who previously have not had
a configuration system browser. The <code>pymenuconfig</code> target is
experimental. When it reaches sufficient feature parity with the
existing <code>menuconfig</code> target, it will replace it, and the C-based
Kconfig tools will be removed from Zephyr.</p>

<p>Further improvements include better error feedback when toolchains are
not found, the list of printed boards now respecting <code>BOARD_ROOT</code>,
and silencing of verbose compiler check messages.</p>

<p><strong>Drivers</strong></p>

<p>There is a new API for LEDs in include/led.h. (Zephyr had an API for
strips of LEDs; this new API is for controlling individual lights.)
The initial API includes support for basic on/off, as well as
brightness and blinking. A driver and sample application for the TI
LP3943 LED controller were also merged.</p>

<p>The ST LSM6DSL inertial module driver saw a cleanup and now supports
sensor hub mode. This allows the LSM6DSL to act as a sensor hub by
connecting additional I2C slave devices through to the driver via the
main communication channel.</p>

<p>STM32L0 and L4 microcontrollers now support the MSI (multi-speed
internal) clock as a system clock source.</p>

<p>The uart_pipe console driver now supports both edge and level
triggering, allowing it to work with CDC ACM.</p>

<p>The MCUX GPIO driver now uses device tree.</p>

<p>A GPIO driver for NXP i.MX SoCs was merged.</p>

<p><strong>Device Tree</strong></p>

<p>Bindings were added for the DesignWare CAVS multilevel interrupt
controller.</p>

<p>GPIO nodes are now present on all Kinetis SoCs.</p>

<p><strong>Documentation</strong></p>

<p>The search results pages for the online Zephyr documentation now have
much cleaner output.</p>

<p>Zephyr&rsquo;s documentation describing its Kconfig usage was re-worked and
improved as part of the transition towards a Python-based menuconfig
alternative.</p>

<p><strong>Kernel</strong></p>

<p>The kernel&rsquo;s scheduler interface was significantly refactored and
cleaned up. The scheduler&rsquo;s system interface was decreased to twelve
functions; notably, usage of _Swap() was removed in various places in
favor of a new _reschedule().</p>

<p>Userspace configurations now support dynamic creation of kernel
objects. Previously, kernel objects (such as mutexes, pipes, and
timers) needed to be declared statically. This is because a special
linker pass is used when building the Zephyr image, which creates a
perfect hash table which was used to validate if a memory address
passed from userspace pointed to a valid kernel object, among other
security checks. In addition to this hash table, Zephyr now supports
maintaining metadata for dynamically created kernel objects using the
new red/black tree implementation that was added in the v1.12
development cycle. Dynamic kernel objects are allocated and freed from
the system heap. The new allocate and free routines are respectively
<code>k_object_alloc()</code> and <code>k_object_free()</code>. They are currently only
callable from supervisor mode.</p>

<p><strong>Libraries</strong></p>

<p>The singly-linked list implementation in include/misc/slist.h is now
implemented in terms of a new macro metaprogramming header,
include/misc/list_gen.h. This new header allows generation of static
inline routines implementing &ldquo;list-like&rdquo; behavior (i.e. defining
operations for getting, removing, inserting, etc.) for any compound
data type that implements a base set of operations. The base
operations from which the others are derived are: initialization;
getting the &ldquo;next&rdquo; node; setting the next, head, and tail nodes;
and peeking at the head and tail nodes.</p>

<p>The JSON library&rsquo;s internal descriptor type is more tightly packed,
using bitfields to place information formerly found in four integers
into 32 bits worth of bitfields. This results in a net savings of
read-only data at a slight increase in text size.</p>

<p><strong>Samples</strong></p>

<p>A sample application demonstrating the BLE broadcaster role by
providing Apple iBeacon functionality was added in
samples/bluetooth/ibeacon.</p>

<p>Samples using LEDs and buttons were updated following the device tree
name change from PORT to CONTROLLER described above.</p>

<p>The LWM2M sample was re-worked to add configuration overlay fragments
for enabling Bluetooth networking and DTLS. The README was updated
with new instructions for building the sample.</p>

<p><strong>Testing</strong></p>

<p>The effort to prepare Zephyr&rsquo;s tests for inclusion in a test
management system continues.</p>

<p>Various tests were cleaned up with style, tag, and category fixes,
along with numerous tests receiving Doxygen-based documentation.</p>

<p>The sanitycheck script now parses test cases declared by a test suite
from the source code, using regular expressions.</p>

<p>Sanitycheck also now supports a <code>--list-tests</code> flag, which prints
declared test cases. Its output can be further refined by passing the
<code>-T</code> option a relative path to a subdirectory of &ldquo;tests&rdquo; (e.g. <code>-T
tests/net/socket</code>).</p>

<p>The test suite core now includes support for skipping tests when they
are not supported.</p>

<p><strong>USB</strong></p>

<p>There was a fair bit of USB-related activity which spanned areas in
the tree.</p>

<p>The USB DFU class driver was heavily re-worked and moved to
subsys/usb/class. The driver now determines the <a href="http://docs.zephyrproject.org/devices/dts/flash_partitions.html">flash
partition</a>
layout for the currently running image and an area to store an update
image via device tree flash partitions, matching Zephyr&rsquo;s MCUboot area
support mechanism. This allows Zephyr applications to add firmware
update support by enabling the USB DFU driver and booting under
MCUboot. Refer to the README and other documentation in
samples/subsys/usb/dfu for more details.</p>

<p>The hci_usb sample application, which allows a Zephyr device which
supports USB and a Bluetooth controller to act as a Bluetooth dongle,
had its core USB operations generalized and migrated into the core USB
subsystem. The sample application is now much smaller; what remains
essentially just enables the driver.</p>

<p>The wpanusb sample, which allows Zephyr applications to expose
802.15.4 radio functionality to a host via USB, saw a major
cleanup. This sample will be more widely useful upon release of
corresponding Linux drivers.</p>

<h2 id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h2>

<p>There were several networking-related bug fixes: a fragment
double-free, a build error for HTTP clients, a buffer overflow in the
hostname storage area, an ARP null network packet dereference, and a
miscalculation of ICMPv6 packet payload length and checksum fields.</p>

<p>Calling pthread_cond_signal() from a cooperative thread no longer
yields.</p>

<p>The irq_lock() compatibility layer on SMP configurations was fixed,
avoiding potential deadlocks when swapping away from a thread that
holds the lock.</p>

<p>The kernel scheduler&rsquo;s validation of priority levels was fixed.</p>

<p>A bug which allowed user mode code to force the kernel to execute code
at address 0x0 has been fixed by introducing an extra validation step
at every syscall entry point.</p>

<p>A race condition which could potentially allow user space code to
modify memory containing I2C messages before the kernel-level handler
runs was closed.</p>

<p>Issues preventing successful thread context switch during exception
return on ARC were fixed. The fatal error handler on that architecture
also no longer hangs the system after aborting a non-essential thread.</p>

<p>The BusFault Status Register bits on ARMv8-M MCUs are now properly
cleared when that fault occurs.</p>

<p>The Bluetooth Mesh implementation continues to become more robust,
with three bug fixes affecting initialization vectors and node
identity advertising, and two other cleanups.</p>

<p>The boot banner now correctly prints the Zephyr &ldquo;git describe&rdquo; output
when the application is outside the Zephyr tree.</p>

<p>A variety of warnings emitted when using dtc version 1.4.6 are now
fixed. These fixes appear to be backwards-compatible.</p>

<p>A variety of USB-related bug fixes went in, including a fix for the
DesignWare driver&rsquo;s excessive generation of zero-length packets, a
missing byte order conversion computation in the common configuration
descriptor, and other fixes and cleanups.</p>

<p>The ST LSM6DSL inertial module driver was converted to use the new SPI
API, following the removal of the old API.</p>
